# Hand Gesture Volume Control

---

### Hand Gesture Controlled Volume using Python and OpenCV

This Python script utilizes computer vision techniques with OpenCV to control system volume based on hand gestures captured by a camera. By detecting specific hand gestures, such as the distance between thumb and index finger, the script dynamically adjusts the system volume accordingly. The distance between fingers is mapped to a range of volume levels, providing an intuitive and hands-free method for volume control. 

#### Features:
- Detects hand gestures in real-time using OpenCV.
- Calculates the distance between specific landmarks on the hand.
- Maps hand gestures to system volume levels.
- Visualizes volume control bar and percentage on the screen.
- Provides real-time feedback on FPS (frames per second).

#### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- pycaw
- comtypes

#### Usage:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Hold your hand in front of the camera and adjust the distance between thumb and index finger to control volume.
4. Press 'q' to quit the program.

Give it a try and experience a new way of controlling your system volume effortlessly!
